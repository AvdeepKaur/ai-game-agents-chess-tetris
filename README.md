# AI Game Agents: Chess and Tetris

This repository contains two AI projects: a Chess Bot and a Tetris Bot, both implemented using different AI techniques.

## Chess Bot

The Chess Bot is an AI agent that plays chess using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm, an enhancement of the Minimax algorithm.

### Features

- Alpha-Beta pruning implementation for efficient game tree search
- Custom heuristics for board evaluation
- Move ordering optimization for improved pruning efficiency

## Tetris Bot

The Tetris Bot uses Q-learning with neural networks to learn and play Tetris.

### Features

- Q-learning implementation with neural networks
- Custom state representation and reward function
- Exploration vs exploitation strategy

## Note

Both projects are part of academic assignments and demonstrate the application of AI techniques in game playing. The Chess Bot focuses on traditional game tree search algorithms, while the Tetris Bot explores reinforcement learning with neural networks.
